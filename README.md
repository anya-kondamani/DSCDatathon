The files I've attached within this repository include my contributions to NYU Data Science Club's 2024 Datathon website. This project was completed in collaboration with two members of the publication committee, Kathy Tran and Ritti Bhogal. This website is intended to act as a resource for all the hackers throughout the duration of the event. It includes information such as scheduling and access to the dataset. The homepage includes a countdown to the end of the event as well as information regarding the sponsor. The FAQ includes important information that pairs with common questions. The buttons in these attached files are not functional for privacy reasons. The fully functional website can be viewed at this link: https://nyudscdatathon2024.com/
